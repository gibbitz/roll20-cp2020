Chameleon is more than the disguise skill in that it allows the spy to emulate the special abilities of his cover roles at a reduced level. The spy may pick two cover abilities best suited to his theater of operations and mission requirements. The level of the cover identity special abilities is equal to the spy's Chameleon skill divided by two for the primary cover and divided by three for the secondary cover. Round up in both instances. Example: A spy must assume the identity of a netrunner, backup role of techie, and he has Chameleon 7. The spy then has Interface 4 (7/2 = 3.5, rounded up to 4) and Jury Rig 3 (7/3 = 2.3, rounded up to 3). This system limits the spy's abilities in his cover role special abilities, but allows him enough latitude to operate without detection for long periods of time. When a spy achieves Chameleon 10, he or she may pick a third cover identity and role. Like the second cover special ability, the third is at Chameleon divided by three. When a third cover role is gained, the spy should construct a history for the cover. While Chameleon is primarily used to represent training in specific roles, it also means an ability to blend into any situation or culture easily. This is more than just a Disguise skill, use it with Persuasion while trying to seem inconspicuous or with Fast Talk to convince someone you belong in that zone, on that vehicle, in that office, etc. It also represents ability at assuming another persona when acting as a mole with artificial behavior, mannerisms and so on. Thus it acts like a Social or Performance skill as well. Chipware can certainly make this job easier, but can be exposed rather easily.

Charismatic Leadership will only work with groups of ten or more people as it is primarily a mob leadership ability. The higher your charismatic Leadership, the larger a crowd you can control and the more direct and complex the instructions you can get them to follow.

Con Men, more than any other type of street operator, use a lot of slang. Another aspect of Con is that it is more than just a Persuasion/Lie skill. It is used to create a real-time illusion that draws the mark in, and if successful, should end with the mark thanking the con man for taking his money.

        "description": "This is a sort of combat sense based on the Nomad philosophy of combat, which focuses typically on either long range weapons or up front, in your face knuckle-dusting brawls. If you ever see a Nomad spraying the camp with an SMG during a battle, you're just as likely to see members of his own pack shoot him down dead right where he stands. Nomads dislike automatic weapons due to the insecurity of their camps. When an enemy eventually sneaks in amongst their tents, a hand gun or bolt action rifle or carbine provides far more safety for the children running around in terror. Warpath adds to Initiative and Awareness, just like Combat Sense for Solos. However, it's full level is added only against other Nomads. When facing others, Only half its level is added in, kind of like an ACPA Trooper's Power Armor Sense or ACPA Sense.",
