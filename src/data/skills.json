Developed as a system for more effective combat hand-gunnery within enclosed spaces, Gun-fu (sometimes known as Gunjitsu) is based on the concept of the handgun as an extension of the user's body. Within this martial art, the handgun is used like a melee weapon. Most commonly, the attacker will run right up to his opponent, shove his gun into the gonk's stomach, and pull the trigger as many times as it takes. The advantage to this is that gunshots delivered at point-blank range do MAXIMUM damage. The basic principle of Gun-fu the handgun as a part of the body also serves to increase fire fight mobility. This martial art reduces the penalty for multiple actions by +1/4 skill level (round down). In this way, Gun-fu allows such combination maneuvers as fast-draws, off-handed shooting, two-weapon attacks and firing while running or dodging to be carried out more effectively note that these modifiers only apply to Point Blank or Close Range distances, and you still need to have a Handgun skill. Gun-fu is a very fast-paced, frantic combat style, requiring physical fitness and shooting skills. It is a favorite of the Triads.",

This skill replaces Martial Arts or Brawling when you fight in a no-gravity situation (if you were to use those other combat styles in 0-G you would end up a helpless spinning tangle of arms and legs). The training also teaches the character how to use recoil weapons in zero gravity. When firing a recoil weapon, he may add this Skill to the required Recoil Save Roll. You must have at least three points in Zero-Gee Maneuver Skill before you can acquire this skill. Your Zero-Gee Combat Skill can never be higher than your skill in Zero Gee Maneuver.",
