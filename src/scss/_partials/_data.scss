Chameleon is more than the disguise skill in that it allows the spy to emulate the special abilities of his cover roles at a reduced level. The spy may pick two cover abilities best suited to his theater of operations and mission requirements. The level of the cover identity special abilities is equal to the spy"s Chameleon skill divided by two for the primary cover and divided by three for the secondary cover. Round up in both instances. Example: A spy must assume the identity of a netrunner, backup role of techie, and he has Chameleon 7. The spy then has Interface 4 (7/2 = 3.5, rounded up to 4) and Jury Rig 3 (7/3 = 2.3, rounded up to 3). This system limits the spy"s abilities in his cover role special abilities, but allows him enough latitude to operate without detection for long periods of time. When a spy achieves Chameleon 10, he or she may pick a third cover identity and role. Like the second cover special ability, the third is at Chameleon divided by three. When a third cover role is gained, the spy should construct a history for the cover. While Chameleon is primarily used to represent training in specific roles, it also means an ability to blend into any situation or culture easily. This is more than just a Disguise skill, use it with Persuasion while trying to seem inconspicuous or with Fast Talk to convince someone you belong in that zone, on that vehicle, in that office, etc. It also represents ability at assuming another persona when acting as a mole with artificial behavior, mannerisms and so on.
